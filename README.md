Star Wars Role-Playing Game using jQuery

Here's how the app works: 

When the game starts, the player chooses a character by clicking on the fighter's picture. 
Player fights as that character for the rest of the game. Player must defeat all of the remaining fighters. The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture.

The player now can start the fight by clickin the 'Attack' button.

Whenever the player clicks attack, its character damages the defender. The opponent will lose HP (health points). Health Points are displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture. 

The opponent character instantly counters the attack. When that happens, the user's character loses some of their HP. Remaining points are shown at the bottom of the picture of the player's character.

Player keeps attacking in an effort to defeat their opponent.

When the defender's HP are reduced to zero or below, the enemy is removed from the defender area. Now the user can choose a new opponent.

Player wins the game by defeating all the enemy characters. Player loses the game if its character's Health Points fall to zero or below.
